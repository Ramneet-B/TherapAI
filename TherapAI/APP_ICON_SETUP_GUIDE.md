## üé® Design Guidelines

### Apple's Requirements
- **Format**: PNG (no JPEG)
- **Color Space**: sRGB or P3
- **No Transparency**: Solid background required
- **No Alpha Channel**: App Store will reject transparent icons
- **Square Format**: 1024x1024 pixels exactly
- **High Quality**: Crisp, clear, and professional looking

### Design Best Practices
1. **Simple and Recognizable**: Should be identifiable at small sizes
2. **Avoid Text**: Icons with text often become unreadable at small sizes
3. **Consistent Brand**: Match your app's overall visual identity
4. **Test at Multiple Sizes**: Ensure clarity at all required sizes
5. **Avoid System Icons**: Don't use iOS system symbols or similar designs

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo
Once you provide your logo, I'll help you:
1. Resize to 1024x1024 pixels
2. Ensure solid background (no transparency)
3. Optimize for clarity at small sizes
4. Convert to proper PNG format

### Step 2: Add to Xcode Project
1. Open `TherapAI.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Navigate to `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`
3. Replace the empty icon slots with your prepared icon
4. Xcode will automatically generate all required sizes

### Step 3: Verify Setup
1. Build and run the app on simulator/device
2. Check that icon appears correctly on home screen
3. Verify icon shows in App Store Connect when uploading

## üìã Current Status

### ‚úÖ Ready for Icon
- App icon configuration is set up in `Assets.xcassets`
- `Contents.json` is properly configured for iOS
- Project settings are correctly pointing to the icon set

### ‚è≥ Waiting for Logo
- Need your final logo design
- Will process and optimize once received
- All technical setup is complete

## üöÄ Integration Steps (Once Logo is Provided)

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Receive Logo**: Get your final logo file
2. **Process Image**: 
   - Resize to 1024x1024px
   - Remove transparency/add solid background
   - Optimize for App Store requirements
3. **Update Assets**: Replace placeholder in `AppIcon.appiconset`
4. **Test Build**: Verify icon appears correctly
5. **Ready for Submission**: App will be ready for App Store

### Logo Specifications Request
When you provide your logo, please ensure:
- **High Resolution**: At least 1024x1024 pixels
- **Vector Format Preferred**: SVG, AI, or high-res PNG
- **Square Aspect Ratio**: Or we can crop/adjust as needed
- **Brand Colors**: Consistent with your brand identity

## üé® Design Suggestions

### For TherapAI Brand
Consider incorporating:
- **Brain/Mind Elements**: Subtle brain imagery or neural patterns
- **Calming Colors**: Soft purples, blues, or gradients
- **Modern Feel**: Clean, minimalist design
- **Therapeutic Vibes**: Peaceful, supportive visual elements
- **AI Aspect**: Subtle tech elements without being too technical

### Color Schemes
Based on your current app theme:
- **Primary**: Purple (#8E4EC6)
- **Secondary**: Blue (#007AFF)
- **Accent**: Gradient combinations
- **Background**: Clean white or soft gradients

## üì± Testing Checklist

Once icon is added:
- [ ] Icon appears on home screen
- [ ] Icon looks good at all sizes
- [ ] No pixelation or distortion
- [ ] Consistent with app branding
- [ ] Passes App Store validation
- [ ] Works in both light and dark mode contexts

## üîÑ Quick Update Process

When you're ready with the logo:
1. **Send me the logo file**
2. **I'll process it** (resize, optimize, format)
3. **Update the project** (replace in Assets.xcassets)
4. **Test the build** (ensure everything looks good)
5. **Ready for submission** (App Store ready!)
