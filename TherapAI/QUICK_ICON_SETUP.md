# ðŸ“± Quick App Icon Setup for TherapAI

## ðŸŽ¯ SUPER EASY METHOD - 3 Minutes!

I created an **App Icon Generator** that uses the same brain symbol and colors from your app!

### Step 1: Access the Icon Generator
1. **Build and run** your app
2. **Go to Home screen**
3. **Tap the "ðŸ“± Generate Icon" button** (bottom right)
4. You'll see your perfect app icon!

### Step 2: Capture the Icon
1. **Take a screenshot** of the icon generator screen
2. **Crop to just the brain icon** (square shape)
3. **Save as PNG**

### Step 3: Generate All Sizes
1. **Go to AppIcon.co** (free online tool)
2. **Upload your cropped icon**
3. **Download the complete iOS icon set** (18 files)

### Step 4: Add to Project
1. **Unzip the downloaded file**
2. **Copy all PNG files** to: `TherapAI/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
3. **Build your app** - icons will appear!

### Step 5: Clean Up
1. **Remove the temporary code:**
   - Delete `IconGenerator.swift`
   - Remove the "ðŸ“± Generate Icon" button from HomeScreen.swift
   - Delete this file (`QUICK_ICON_SETUP.md`)
